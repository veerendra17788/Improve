`Single Element in a Sorted Array`
this problem we can solve by intution of `even and odd palces`

we have to eleminate an half which position of dupilicate misplaced

`note`:
    first check if either first or last is the single or not and
    start with index low=1 and high=n-2 by this we can make our coe simpler

if element before min and after mid is not equal then it our required single element
