Project Idea: Develop a music mood analysis application that analyses the mood of a user and generates playlists accordingly. Users can input their mood, and the app will recommend playlists or songs to match that mood.
Skills to Learn:
* Audio Signal Processing: Learn to analyse audio features like tempo, pitch, and energy using libraries like Librosa in Python.
* Machine Learning: Implement machine learning algorithms to classify music based on mood.
* React js for Frontend: Build a user interface for inputting mood and displaying recommended playlists.
* Node js for Backend: Create an API to handle mood analysis requests and playlist generation.
