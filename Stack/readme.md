Stack is very importatnt data structure

identification:
    if problem revolves around array we can basically thick of stack
    `imp`: if we can solve any problem with O(n^2) and one for loop is 
    depend on another loop we can strongly think of stack
    `eg`: 
        for(int i=0; i< n; i++){
            for(int j=i; j< n; j++){
                .......
            }
        }
