# System Design Principles

## <span style="color:blue;">1. Optimize Processor and Increase Throughput Using the Same Resources</span>
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Implement techniques like caching, efficient algorithms, and minimizing context switching to ensure the processor and other resources are used effectively.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Utilize multi-threading and parallel processing to maximize CPU utilization.
- **Load Distribution**: Distribute the load evenly across all processors to prevent any single processor from becoming a bottleneck.

**Example**: In a web server handling multiple requests, implement a thread pool to manage concurrent requests efficiently and reduce overhead from creating and destroying threads.

## <span style="color:green;">2. Preparing Beforehand at Non-Peak Hours</span>
- **Batch Processing**: Perform heavy computations or batch jobs during off-peak hours to minimize the load during peak times.
- **Prefetching**: Prefetch data that will likely be needed during peak hours.
- **Scheduled Maintenance**: Schedule maintenance tasks and updates during non-peak hours to minimize downtime and user impact.

**Example**: An e-commerce website can generate recommendation data overnight based on user activity, so the data is ready for use during peak shopping hours.

## <span style="color:purple;">3. Keep Backups and Avoid Single Points of Failure</span>
- **Redundancy**: Have redundant systems in place to take over in case of failure.
- **Regular Backups**: Regularly backup data to prevent loss in case of hardware or software failure.
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Implement failover mechanisms that automatically switch to a backup system if the primary system fails.

**Example**: Use a master-slave database setup where the slave can take over if the master fails.

## <span style="color:orange;">4. Horizontal Scaling (Hire More Resources)</span>
- **Add More Servers**: Increase the number of servers to handle more load.
- **Distributed Load**: Distribute the load evenly across multiple servers.
- **Stateless Services**: Ensure services are stateless to easily distribute them across multiple servers.

**Example**: A web application can add more web servers behind a load balancer to handle increased traffic.

## <span style="color:red;">5. Microservices Architecture</span>
- **Decoupled Services**: Break down the application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service should have a single responsibility and focus on doing it well.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Use lightweight protocols like REST or gRPC for communication between services.

**Example**: An online shopping platform can have separate microservices for user management, product catalog, order processing, and payment handling.

## <span style="color:teal;">6. Distributed System (Partitioning)</span>
- **Data Partitioning**: Distribute data across multiple servers to improve performance and availability.
- **Consistent Hashing**: Use consistent hashing to distribute data evenly and handle server additions/removals efficiently.
- **Replication**: Replicate data across multiple nodes to ensure availability and fault tolerance.

**Example**: A NoSQL database like Cassandra partitions data across a cluster of nodes and replicates it to ensure high availability.

## <span style="color:brown;">7. Load Balancing</span>
- **Distribute Traffic**: Use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.
- **Health Checks**: Implement health checks to route traffic away from unhealthy servers.
- **Sticky Sessions**: Use sticky sessions if session persistence is required, ensuring subsequent requests from the same client go to the same server.

**Example**: An API gateway can balance the load across multiple backend servers, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed.

## <span style="color:gray;">8. Decoupling</span>
- **Loose Coupling**: Ensure components are loosely coupled to minimize dependencies.
- **Message Queues**: Use message queues to decouple producers and consumers, allowing them to operate independently.
- **Service Interfaces**: Define clear interfaces for services to interact with each other.

**Example**: Use RabbitMQ to decouple a web application from a background job processing system, allowing the web server to enqueue tasks and continue handling requests without waiting for job completion.

## <span style="color:violet;">9. Metrics Collection and Logging</span>
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system performance and health metrics.
- **Centralized Logging**: Collect and centralize logs from all components for easy access and analysis.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts to notify administrators of any issues or unusual patterns.

**Example**: Use Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization, along with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging and analysis.

## <span style="color:gold;">10. Extensibility</span>
- **Modular Design**: Design systems in a modular way to easily add new features or services.
- **APIs**: Provide APIs to allow external services to interact with your system.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can scale horizontally by adding more instances as needed.

**Example**: A content management system (CMS) can provide plugins and APIs to allow third-party developers to add new features without modifying the core system.
