# Getting Started with Github

## What is Github?

Github is a web-based Git repository hosting service that facilitates collaboration among developers. It provides tools for version control, project management, code review, and team collaboration. Github is widely used for hosting open source projects and sharing code repositories.

### Alternatives to Github

While Github is popular, alternatives include Gitlab, Bitbucket, Azure Repos, and Gitea.

## Github Account

Creating a Github account is straightforward and free. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Visit the Github website and click on “Sign up”.
2. Enter your email address, create a password, and complete the registration process.

## Configure Git Settings

Before using Github, configure your Git settings with your email and username:

```bash
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Verify your Git config settings:

```bash
git config --list
```

## Setup SSH Key and Add to Github

Using SSH keys with Github provides a secure way to authenticate. Follow these steps to set up SSH:

1. Generate a new SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
   ```

2. Save the key to your computer and add it to the SSH agent.

3. Add the SSH key to your Github account via the Github website.

## Adding Code to Remote Repository

Once your SSH key is set up, you can start pushing code to a remote repository on Github:

1. Create a new repository on your local system, add code, and commit it:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "commit message"
   ```

2. Check the remote URL setting:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

3. Add a remote repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <remote-url>
   ```
   Replace `<remote-url>` with the URL of your Github repository.

4. Push code to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Setting Upstream Remote

Setting an upstream remote allows you to synchronize your local repository with changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream <remote-url>
```
or shorthand:
```bash
git remote add -u <remote-url>
```

Push code and set upstream in one step:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Getting Code from Remote Repository

You can fetch or pull code from a remote repository to your local repository:

### Fetch Code
To download code from a remote repository:
```bash
git fetch <remote-name>
```


### Pull Code
To download and merge code from a remote repository:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've covered the basics of setting up and using Github, including configuring Git, setting up SSH keys, pushing code to a remote repository, setting upstream remotes, and fetching/pulling code. These steps should help you get started with Git and Github effectively.
