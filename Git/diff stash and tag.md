# Git and GitHub Tutorial

## Terminology
Git users have a unique terminology:
- **Repository**: A collection of files and directories stored together. Similar to a folder but can also contain other repositories.
- **Branch**: An "alternative timeline" for your code changes.

## Checking Your Git Version
To check your Git version, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git --version
```

This command displays the version of Git installed on your system.

## Repository
A repository is a collection of files and directories stored together. It is similar to a folder but also includes Git-specific elements that help manage and track your code. 

To check the current state of your repository, use:

```sh
git status
```

Not all folders are tracked by Git. Only those initialized as repositories will be tracked.

## Configuring Git
GitHub has several settings you can configure, such as your username and email. These settings are stored in a Git config file and can be global or repository-specific.

To set your email and username globally, use:

```sh
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

To check your config settings, use:

```sh
git config --list
```

## Creating a Repository
To create a new repository, initialize a new folder with Git tracking:

```sh
git init
```

This command creates a `.git` directory in your project folder.

## Commit
A commit saves your changes to the repository, similar to a snapshot of your code at a specific time. Use the following commands to commit your changes:

```sh
git add <file> <file2>
git commit -m "commit message"
```

The `-m` flag adds a commit message describing your changes.

## Complete Git Flow
The basic Git workflow involves:
1. Initializing a repository: `git init`
2. Adding files to the staging area: `git add <file> <file2>`
3. Committing changes: `git commit -m "commit message"`
4. Pushing changes to GitHub: `git push`

## Staging
Staging allows you to prepare files for a commit. Use the following commands to stage and check the status of your files:

```sh
git add <file> <file2>
git status
```

## Logs
To view the history of your repository, use:

```sh
git log
```

To make the log output more compact, use the `--oneline` flag:

```sh
git log --oneline
```

## Atomic Commits
Atomic commits ensure each commit is a self-contained unit of work, allowing you to revert to a previous commit if needed.

## Changing the Default Code Editor
To change the default code editor to VSCode, use:

```sh
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

## .gitignore
A `.gitignore` file tells Git which files and directories to ignore. Create a `.gitignore` file and list the files and directories to ignore:

Example `.gitignore` file:

```
node_modules
.env
.vscode
```

This prevents Git from tracking the specified files and directories.

## Conclusion
In this section, we learned the basics of Git, including how to check the version, configure settings, create a repository, commit changes, and use essential commands like `add`, `commit`, and `log`. By understanding these basics, you can effectively use Git to manage your code.

# Git Behind the Scenes

## Git Snapshots
A Git snapshot is a point in time in the history of your code. It represents a specific version of your code, including all the files and folders that were present at that time. Each snapshot is identified by a unique hash code, a string of characters representing the contents of the snapshot.

A snapshot is not an image but a representation of the code at a specific point in time. Git stores this information in a locally stored key-value based database. Everything is stored as an object, and each object is identified by a unique hash code.

## The Three Musketeers of Git

### Commit Object
Each commit in the project is stored in the `.git` folder as a commit object, which contains the following information:
- Tree Object
- Parent Commit Object
- Author
- Committer
- Commit Message

### Tree Object
A Tree Object is a container for all the files and folders in the project. It contains the following information:
- File Mode
- File Name
- File Hash
- Parent Tree Object

Everything is stored as key-value pairs in the tree object. The key is the file name, and the value is the file hash.

### Blob Object
A Blob Object is present in the tree object and contains the actual file content. This is where the file content is stored.

## Helpful Commands
Here are some helpful commands to explore Git internals:

### Show Commit Object
```sh
git show -s --pretty=raw <commit-hash>
```

### Show Tree Object
Grab the tree id from the above command and use it in the following command to get the tree object:
```sh
git ls-tree <tree-id>
```

### Show Blob Object
Grab the blob id from the above command and use it in the following command to get the blob object:
```sh
git show <blob-id>
```

### Show Commit Object Details
Grab the commit id from the above command and use it in the following command to get the commit object:
```sh
git cat-file -p <commit-id>
```

# Branches in Git

## Branches
Branches allow you to work on different versions of a project simultaneously. They enable you to create a separate line of development independent of the main branch, useful for making changes without affecting the main branch or for working on new features or bug fixes.

Example: Developers can work on Header, Footer, Content, and Layout simultaneously, each in their own branch.

## HEAD in Git
HEAD is a pointer to the current branch you are working on. It points to the latest commit in the current branch. When you create a new branch, it is automatically set as the HEAD of that branch.

**Note**: The default branch used to be called `master`, but it is now commonly called `main`. This is just a convention and holds no special significance.

## Creating a New Branch
To create and switch to a new branch, use the following commands:

```sh
git branch         # List all branches in the current repository
git branch bug-fix # Create a new branch called bug-fix
git switch bug-fix # Switch to the bug-fix branch
git log            # Show the commit history for the current branch
git switch main    # Switch to the main branch
git switch -c dark-mode # Create a new branch called dark-mode and switch to it
git checkout orange-mode # Switch to the orange-mode branch
```

## Commit Before Switching Branches
Before switching branches, ensure you have committed your changes. This prevents conflicts and potential data loss.

## Merging Branches

### Fast-Forward Merge
A fast-forward merge occurs when the branch you are trying to merge is ahead and there are no conflicts. Use the following commands:

```sh
git checkout main
git merge bug-fix
```

### Not Fast-Forward Merge
A not fast-forward merge happens when both branches have new commits. This requires resolving conflicts. Use the following commands:

```sh
git checkout main
git merge bug-fix
```

**Difference**: In a fast-forward merge, there are no conflicts. In a not fast-forward merge, you must manually resolve conflicts, deciding what to keep and discard. VSCode has a built-in merge tool to assist with this.

## Managing Conflicts
Conflicts must be resolved manually. VSCode provides a merge tool to help resolve conflicts, as does GitHub. Effective conflict resolution involves communication and understanding the code with your team members.

## Rename a Branch
To rename a branch, use:

```sh
git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>
```

## Delete a Branch
To delete a branch, use:

```sh
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

## Checkout a Branch
To switch to a branch, use:

```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```

## List All Branches
To list all branches, use:

```sh
git branch
```

## Conclusion
In this section, we learned about different types of merges, resolving conflicts, and the importance of branching and merging in Git and GitHub. By the end of this section, you should have a good understanding of how to use Git and GitHub effectively.
