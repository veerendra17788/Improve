# Git and GitHub Tutorial

## Introduction

### What is Git?
Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your files and collaborate with others. It is used to manage the history of your code and to merge changes from different branches. This tutorial will introduce you to key concepts like version control, branches, and merges.

### Git vs. GitHub
- **Git**: A version control system used to track changes to your files. It is free, open-source software available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Git can be installed directly on your computer.
- **GitHub**: A web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It allows you to store, share, and collaborate on code projects online. GitHub is one of the most popular platforms for developers to collaborate on projects, but it is not the only provider of Git repositories.

## Version Control Systems
Version control systems (VCS) manage the history of your code, allowing you to track changes and collaborate with others. They are essential for software development, similar to checkpoints in a game where you can revert to a previous state.

Before Git, systems like Source Code Control System (SCCS) were used, but they were expensive and not user-friendly. Git was created to make version control more accessible and user-friendly. Other common VCS include Subversion (SVN), CVS, and Perforce.

## Learning Path
In this tutorial, we will:
1. **Get the basics**: Understand core concepts.
2. **Use it daily**: Practice using Git regularly.
3. **Face the problems**: Encounter and solve common issues.
4. **Solve them**: Learn troubleshooting.
5. **Learn more**: Dive into advanced topics.

We will start with Git first, and once you understand Git, moving towards GitHub will be easy.

## Installing Git
To install Git, you can use the command line or visit the official website to download the installer for your operating system. Git is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Creating an Account on GitHub
Another step is to create an account on GitHub. Later in the tutorial, we will walk you through linking your GitHub account with your machine. You cannot push your code to GitHub without setting up SSH-key authentication. Password authentication is not recommended and is not possible to use anymore. We will cover SSH-key setup in a later part of the tutorial.

## Conclusion
In this part, we have learned the basics of Git and GitHub. We have also learned how to install Git and create a GitHub account. We have discussed the importance of version control systems and their role in software development. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a good understanding of Git and GitHub and will be able to use them to manage your code effectively.
